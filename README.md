# SudokuSolver

A program that works out the solution to a sudoku puzzle by using human tactics and proofs.

It is designed with speed in mind, but there are still many improvements to be had. I'm currently just trying to write each tactic before optimizing further.


The form draws the puzzle and its changes. If it gets stuck, the candidates for each cell will be shown for debugging:

Once design is done, of course, there will be no candidates showing, as every cell will be filled (assuming the input puzzle is valid).
